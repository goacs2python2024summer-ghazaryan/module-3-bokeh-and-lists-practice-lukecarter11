# GOACS2 Module 2 - Bokeh and Lists Practice

In this assignment, you will import a **Python package** called `bokeh` to help you run some sample code.  
  
You will also create a number of programs to practice lists, as described in the Canvas assignment. See the assignment page for additional instructions.

This sample program is from the Bokeh website. You can see information about the dataset here: https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/sprint.html

Instructions for importing packages are below. The most important steps are <ins>underlined</ins>.


> 1. <ins>Open the Terminal</ins>
>     * At the top of the VSCode window, you'll see the Terminal menu in the menu bar. 
Choose `New Terminal` from the menu, or use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + \` on Windows or `command` + `shift` + \`on Mac
> 2. Install the required package(s)
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `pip install bokeh`</ins>
>     * Bokeh is the package used in this sample program.
>     * IF THIS DOESN'T WORK - please try the following:
>       * upgrade pip using the following command: `pip install --upgrade pip` and try `pip install bokeh` again.
>       * use pip3 instead of pip, for example `pip3 install bokeh`
> 3. Choose your Interpreter
>     * If VS Code still doesn't recognize the import code at the top of the program, we will have to determine which interpreter has Bokeh installed.
>     * <ins>At the bottom of VS Code is a version of Python. Click on this, then choose the version of Python interpreter where the package was installed.</ins> You'll know you've chosen the right one when VS Code recognizes the bokeh module.
> 4. Run the program
>     * Select the `bokehsample.py` file in the explorer
>         * If you don't see the file list, click on the icon on the top left of the window
>     * Click the play button on the top right of the window
